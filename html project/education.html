	<h2>Elementry School </h2>
	<p style="clear: both;">I Started school at Kirkwood Elementry when I was five years old. As you probably
	guessed it was all downhill from there...Kidding! Kirkwood elementry was really close to my house, so close that it 
	was only a block from my house so it only took five minutes to walk to it. Since this is just elementry school and I was a pretty shy
	kid, theres nothing much more to talk about.</p>

	<h2 style="clear: both;">High-School</h2>
	<p style="clear: both;">High-School is actually where I really started to develop into who I am today. For one thing I was less shy and I discovered that I really wanted to become an engineer instead
	of a vet, although I didn't know what field I wanted to get into so I took a class that explores the different areas of engineering. By then I was set on attending Graceland but graceland
	didn't offer a engineering degree but one of the subjects I was a little bit interested in was coding, which I found out that Graceland does offer a computer science degree. So to make sure
	that I would be absolutely like computer science I took AP computer science my senior year. I had a tough time with it and ended up dropping it by the third semester. However, I decided that 
	I did like coding and decided that I would try to pursue it further at Graceland.</p>

		<h2 style="clear: both;">Junior High-School </h2>
		<p>It wasn't that hard to go from elementry school to Junior High, mostly because the junior high school was across from my elementry school. I'm not going to 
		sugar coat it, like most of junior high experiences, it sucked. While it was a bad experience it wasn't all bad I discovered that I was meant more for technition type stuff 
		and not for sports after I finished my second year of basketball.</p>

		<h2 style="clear: both;">College</h2>
		<p>Last year I started my freshman year at Graceland University as a Computer Science Major. Graceland University is a libral arts college with a population of over 
		1000 students. I was placed on the house Cheville and became an active member. So much so that I took a leadership position as House Chaplain. Graceland has also given me 
		even more oppertunities like being part of the Improv Club, ACM club, CHC president and I got to work at the Graceland University Radio Station. Right now I am finishing 
		up my second year here and I think I chose the right college for me. Graceland is a small university compared to other schools which made class sizes small which is a huge
		benifit for me. I have also fell in love with the community here.</p>
