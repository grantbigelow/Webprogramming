  <h2>Where Im From </h2>
  <p>I am from Iowa City, IA. Well more specifically Coralville, IA. I have lived
  there my entire life. (well minus college) the population is 20,397. This number fluxuates
mostly because Iowa city is home to the University of Iowa, So Students move in and out
during breaks and when school is in session. This can mean that traffic is somewhat hetic
at times because of all the students that live there. Which can make my commute to work
when im back home from college pretty tough. I do like living there mostly because it is a city
but not a huge city so I dont feel cramped going to, for example, downtown Iowa City. 
	<h2>Religous Life</h2>
	<p>My family is from the Caltholic church, and for most of my life I have been part of that church and have went through the sacraments that the Caltholic church has.
	However, the Catholic church didn't have any youth programs so instead my mother had me join a monthly youth program at my local community of christ church called Jam Kids,
	which stood for Jesus and Me. It was there that I became really involved with the Community of Christ from volenteering at JAM kids when I became to old for it, to going to 
	the Summer Youth camps that the Community of Christ offered which is where I met some of my really good friends, and then they convinced me to come to Graceland in the first place. 
	From there I became so Involved with the Church that by the summer of my senior year I decided that it made sense to become baptized in the Community of Christ church and by none
	other than my friend who I met at the youth camps that I went to.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p> I come from a house hold of five people. First there is my younger brother Gavin. Gavin is 16 years old and a junior in Highschool. Then there is My older sister Anna. Anna is
22 years old and lives a town over with her husband and my brother in law, Paul. Finally there are my parents, Carla and Dennis. Although my family can be a pain sometimes, they are still family. 
Finally I have three different pets with the exception of the many many fish that live in my mom's fish tank. I have a dog named Percy who is 11 years old and likes me way better than my brother. 
Then I have a 9 month year old cat named Jax, who is probably the biggest trouble maker out of the three. Jax is always climbing on things and knocking things over but is extremly playful.
Finally our newest pet is a year and a half old cat named Reggie. Reggie is probably the opposite of jax. Reggie is a rescue cat that we picked up a couple months ago. Reggie likes
to hide alot in the basment but he is slowly opening up the family. Jax is always tackling Reggie to the ground and playing with him.</p>
<h2>Other Information about me</h2>
<p> I currently am the chaplain of Cheville. I am finishing up my sophmore year. I am a computer science major with a minor in psychology. I know how to play the trumpet, and the 
Ukelele. Next year I will have the oppertunity of serving a CHC president. At school I work as a TA for computer science classes and at home I work at the University of Iowa
hospitals and clinics, in the storeroom. This involves me stocking cafeterias and such. My hobbies include hanging out with friends, video games, and practicing my instruments. Some of 
my favorite movies are Star wars: the empire strikes back, django unchained, and avatar.</p>
